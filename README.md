For part 1, the file Fruit is the super class, use the subclasses Apple and Orange to compile it

For part 2, the file Shape is the superclass of Triangle, Square, and Circle, ShapeDemo is superclass of Shape, use all previously stated files with ShapeDemo to compile it

(PS. this is the first time I've done this so my bad if this doesnt make sense or anything)
